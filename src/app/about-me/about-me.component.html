        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I am a junior Front-End developer based in Neugersdorf, Germany. I have gained experience in developing Web
            and Mobile applications with Angular and Javascript. Since iÂ´am a Robot programer i have always
            been fascinated in IT and especially programming. So I used the chance in Developer Akademie to dive into new
            projects and challanges. Now my enthusiasm turned into a passion. </p>
